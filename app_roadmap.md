# App Roadmap: Video Content Summarizer

This document outlines the step-by-step plan to transform the Video Content Summarizer from a static frontend into a fully functional, production-ready web application.

---

## 1. Backend Development

- **Choose Backend Framework:**  
  Decide on a backend technology (e.g., Python Flask, FastAPI, Node.js Express).
- **Set Up Project Structure:**  
  Create a backend directory and initialize the project.
- **Implement API Endpoints:**  
  - `POST /summarize/url` — Accepts a video URL, downloads/transcribes, and summarizes.
  - `POST /summarize/upload` — Accepts a video file upload, processes, and summarizes.
- **Integrate Video Processing:**  
  - Use libraries like `yt-dlp` or `pytube` for YouTube downloads.
  - Use `ffmpeg` for audio extraction.
  - Integrate speech-to-text (e.g., OpenAI Whisper, Google Speech-to-Text).
- **Integrate Summarization Model:**  
  - Use OpenAI GPT, Hugging Face Transformers, or similar for text summarization.
- **Handle Errors and Edge Cases:**  
  - Validate URLs and file types.
  - Handle long videos, unsupported formats, and API failures.
- **Enable CORS:**  
  Allow frontend to communicate with backend if on different origins.

## 2. Frontend Enhancements

- **Connect to Backend:**  
  Replace demo/fake summary logic with real API calls to backend endpoints.
- **Improve Video Preview:**  
  - For URLs: Show embedded YouTube/Vimeo player if possible.
  - For uploads: Show video preview as currently implemented.
- **User Feedback:**  
  - Show loading spinners and error messages.
  - Display progress for long-running tasks (optional).
- **Accessibility & UX:**  
  - Ensure keyboard navigation and screen reader support.
  - Add tooltips/help for summary types and length.

---

## 3. Testing

- **Unit Tests:**  
  Write tests for backend endpoints and core logic.
- **Integration Tests:**  
  Test end-to-end flow from frontend to backend.
- **Manual QA:**  
  - Try various video sources and formats.
  - Test on different browsers and devices.

---

## 4. Deployment Preparation

- **Environment Variables:**  
  Store API keys and secrets securely.
- **Production Build:**  
  - Minify frontend assets.
  - Set up backend for production (e.g., Gunicorn for Flask).
- **Cloud Storage (Optional):**  
  Use S3 or similar for handling large video uploads.

---

## 5. Deployment

- **Choose Hosting:**  
  - Frontend: Vercel, Netlify, or static site hosting.
  - Backend: Render, Heroku, AWS, Azure, etc.
- **Domain & SSL:**  
  Set up custom domain and HTTPS.
- **Monitor & Log:**  
  Add logging and error monitoring (e.g., Sentry).

---

## 6. Post-Launch

- **Collect Feedback:**  
  Add a feedback form or analytics.
- **Iterate:**  
  Improve based on user feedback and bug reports.
- **Scale:**  
  Optimize for performance and handle increased load.

---

## 7. Optional Features

- **User Authentication:**  
  Allow users to save summaries/history.
- **Multi-language Support:**  
  Summarize videos in different languages.
- **Export Options:**  
  Download summary as PDF, DOCX, etc.
- **API Access:**  
  Allow programmatic access for other apps.

## Milestones Overview

1. **Backend MVP:**  
   - API endpoints working with basic summarization.
2. **Frontend Integration:**  
   - Real summaries shown in the UI.
3. **Testing & QA:**  
   - All major flows tested.
4. **Production Deployment:**  
   - Live on custom domain.
5. **Feedback & Iteration:**  
   - Ready for real users.
