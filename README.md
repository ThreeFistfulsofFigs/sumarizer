## Backend Integration

> **Note:**  
> The current frontend expects a backend API with the following endpoints:
>
> - `POST /summarize/url` for summarizing videos from a URL
> - `POST /summarize/upload` for summarizing uploaded video files
>
> The backend should accept form data and return a JSON response:
> ```json
> { "summary": "Your generated summary here." }
> ```

---

## How to Run

1. **Frontend:**  
   Open `index.html` in your browser.

2. **Backend (to be implemented):**  
   - Create a backend server (e.g., Flask, FastAPI, Node.js).
   - Implement endpoints as described above.
   - Enable CORS if running frontend and backend on different ports.

## Example Workflow

1. User opens the app and selects either URL or Upload.
2. User enters a video URL or uploads a file.
3. User selects summary type and length.
4. User clicks "Generate Summary".
5. The app sends a request to the backend and displays the summary.
6. User can copy the summary to clipboard.

## Customization & Extension

- **Add more summary types** by updating the `<select>` in `index.html`.
- **Improve video preview** by integrating with YouTube/Vimeo APIs.
- **Enhance backend** with better AI models or additional languages.
